# Your Weather App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It wil
display the current weather on a location of your choice based on data form [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/API#weather). In order to run this app, you need to create a config file in the following format:

```
{
    "apiKey": "<YOUR_API_KEY>,
    "baseUrl": "https://api.openweathermap.org/",
    "units": "metric"
}
```
